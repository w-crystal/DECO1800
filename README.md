世界的真理，我已解明！
哭圖嗎促嘎如

I have a confession to make. 
It is regarding my love/hate relationship with GitHub 

An hour ago I thought, who even needs romance? 
I don't need romance. I need successful debug results
I thought GitHub was the one for me. 
Sometimes I can't help but marvel at my own immaculate programming technique
"Holy **** it actually ******* works, I'm a genius." 
The type satisfaction of creating functional code;
rivals that of the most tender confessions of love.
Those times I chased dopamine through artworks would soon meet a new contender.
Could this be my future? 
Could GitHub be the one?

But just like actual dating, it is so excurciatingly frustrating sometimes
Like Jesus Christ please just let me discard these ******* changes bro
I'm not even asking for much. I'm willing to do the work again
Just get a ******* move on please. 
GitHub pisses me off sometimes

The way I talk had the sound of its voice 
The way I type was tainted by its shadow 

Some day, somewhere, I'll always be reminded of all the red flags. 
Maybe I believe that some day I will become good enough for it.
Maybe, I can change them to who I want them to be.
But always, I am met with the harsh reality. 
And yet, I live on in this toxic situationship
with programming. 

On the bright side the welcome page works now. I think it's pretty cool
